The common ones include:\n</p><ul><li>The most common cause is [itching and scratching #DD18], pulling out the hairs. This is commonly caused by: <ul><li>[External parasites #178]: <ul><li>[Fleas] - although fleas themselves do not cause hair loss, scratching and itching does.</li>\n<li>[Mange #045] - usually very itchy and sore, often with scabs and a crust.</li>\n<li>[Demodex #188] mites - usually not itchy, perhaps a mild rash and marked bald patches.</li>\n</ul></li><li>[Skin infections (pyoderma)] - bacterial infections usually cause skin reddening, hair loss, soreness and/or itching, and sometimes pustules (spots or zits) on the skin.</li>\n<li>[Allergies] and [food allergies].</li>\n<li>[Ringworm #214] - this is a fungal disease that usually causes circular or patchy bald patches, often with scaly skin. It is quite contagious to other pets and people.</li>\n<li>Certain inflammatory or [immune disorders] may damage the skin causing hair loss, e.g. [pemphigus], [sebaceous adenitis].</li>\n</ul></li><li>[Behavioural problems] that cause overgrooming, e.g. [separation anxiety].</li>\n<li>[Endocrinopathies #294] - hormone disorders often result in thinning of the coat and symmetrical bald patches (often the same on both flanks). <ul><li>[Cushing's Disease #299] - excessive production of the stress hormone cortisol.</li>\n<li>[Hypothyroidism #096] - insufficient production of thyroid hormone.</li>\n<li>Sex hormone abnormalities - quite rare and usually a result of a hormone-producing tumour e.g. a [Sertoli cell testicular tumour] or a granulosa cell ovarian tumour.</li>\n</ul></li><li>Damage to the skin, e.g. scarring from wounds, surgery or [burns].</li>\n<li>Occasionally, although it's rare, our dog may be suffering from a true [alopecia #281] condition - where hair falls out for no obvious reason. These include: <ul><li>Alopecia X - also known as Hair Funk and Hair Cycle Arrest; it may be the same condition as Castration Responsive Alopecia and Growth-Hormone Responsive Alopecia.</li>\n<li>Seasonal Alopecia - also known as Flank Alopecia.</li>\n<li>[Colour Dilution Alopecia #284].</li>\n<li>[Black Hair Follicular Dysplasia #285].</li>\n<li>Zinc-Responsive Dermatosis.</li>\n<li>Post-clipping Alopecia.</li>\n<li>[Post-injection Hair Loss #289].</li>\n</ul></li></ul><span>Most of these conditions are potentially manageable and some can be cured with appropriate treatment, so if your dog is losing his or her hair, it's really important to get them checked out by your vet! They will check for parasites and other skin diseases (with skin scrapes, wets paper and tape strip tests), and if negative will usually start blood tests for [endocrinopathies #294]. Only once these have been ruled out can you start to consider alopecia conditions such as Alopecia X. </span>"

      "html": "<p>Colour Dilution Alopecia, a follicular dysplasia of colour-dilute hairs, is associated with <b>defective hair pigmentation and formation</b>. Its cause is believed to be <b>genetic </b>(a recessive gene). It's most common in colour-dilute dogs such as those bred to be blue or fawn. The disorder is especially common in Dobermans and Irish Red and White Setters, but it also occurs in other breeds, such as Yorkshire terriers, miniature pinschers, Great Danes, Whippets, Italian greyhounds, Salukis, Chow Chows, Dachshunds, Silky terriers, Boston terriers, Newfoundlands, Bernese Mountain dogs, Shetland sheep dogs, Schiperkes, Chihuahuas, and Poodles.\n<br><br>Dogs that are affected with Colour-Dilution Alopecia appear normal at birth, but then begin losing hair over the body <b>between 6 months and 2 years</b> of age. The coat thinning often progresses to partial or complete hair loss, but <b>only the colour-diluted hairs (pale or banded) are lost</b> and normal (or dark) coloured markings are not affected. Secondary skin infection is also common.\n<br><br>A vet can diagnose colour-dilution alopecia by first <b>ruling out other causes of hair loss</b> (especially hormone disorders such as Cushing's disease and Hypothyroidism), then microscopic examination of plucked hairs and sometimes a skin biopsy. There is no treatment that reverses or prevents further hair loss, but the skin infections should be treated. Your vet may treat the dog with mild antiseborrheic (scaly skin) or antibacterial shampoos and conditioners as needed. Some dogs, however, periodically need systemic antibiotics for secondary skin infection. The prognosis for colour dilution alopecia is usually good: although <b>the hair loss is irreversible, as it is a cosmetic problem, and doesn't influence quality of life</b>.\n</p>"
